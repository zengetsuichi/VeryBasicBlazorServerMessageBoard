We\u2019re driving normally, We live in a very populated area in California,so its not deserted. We stop at a red light intersection and My brother starts freaking out saying \u201C What the $%^$, LOOK BRO LOOK UP\u201D, I then see my sister say \u201C YO WHAT THE ^$^$, LOOK\u201D. i start tripping out and i lean forward and there it is, Lower than the height of a police helicopter looking for someone, Its CLOSE, like out of a movie, V shaped, 3 Lights on each wing, I could see the metal, It looked so real. We look at each other and looked back up and it was gone. Just gone. as if it showing itself was a mistake or something."},{"Id":5,"OwnerId":0,"Title":null,"PostText":null}]
